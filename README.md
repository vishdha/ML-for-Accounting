# ML-for-Accounting
My main motivation in this course to introduce ML with supervised and unsupervised learning algo and make custom app for ERPNext Accounting or perhaps contribute it into ERPNext.

To Run Data Exploration.py. First Need to install all python packages like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and SNS(optional)

$ pip install pandas
$ pip install matplotlib
$ pip install seaborn

UPDATE:
I tired to gather some demo data from Bloomstack demo generator. I tried to look for result in Item Wise Sales History.

I add sample for Item_wise_sales_history.csv
and result we got for same is
